# Working with Swift Datatypes

**NOTE: Please ensure you have successfully setup XCode. Do NOT use Big Sur Settings**

1. Create a Playground Project by selecting `File > New > Playground`
2. Create 2 variables called `firstName` and `lastName`. Assign them in this way: `firstName = <yourFirstName>`
3. Now create a variable called `fullName` in this way: `var fullName: String = <yourFullName>`. What do you think the difference is?
4. Create a variable called `dateOfBirth` in this way: `let dateOfBirth = YYYY/MM/DD`. Now change it value. What's the result?
5. Try to concatenate(combine) the first and last name variables. How did you do this?
6. Create a variable called age that uses either of the above methods. Using concatenation, make the output read: `<fullName> is <age> years old`. What happens? Now, retry it, using this format: `<fullName> is (String)<age> years old`. Is this helpful? Why?
7. Type `(Int)fullName`. What's the output? What did you expect?

# Thinking about your project

Begin reviewing the work you have done in previous modules. Which, if any would make a good candidate for a native mobile app? What ideas or problems are you interested in solving that would benefit from this? Shortlist 3 or 4 and _be ready_ to discuss in class.
